Research was split between members. As one coded the other did the research.

The game: In java
The java files are, PongGame, CreateWindow, BallPaddle and should be downloaded into one folder and run from an java ide or cmd from CreateWindow.java
The java code is meant to act as the demo of the game.

It works well. A welcome window greets the player.When the "Let's Play" button is clicked they are introduced to start. 
The player wins once they reach 7 points

The game: In Android Studio Code
It doesnt work.
ABall.java, APaddle.java, APongGame.java, CreateWindowTwo.java,  must be uploaded/refacted under java in android studio

activity_main.xml must be refacted under layout under res
arcade.ttf refacted under font
cground.jpg refacted under drawable.

The above the should be done in the same project and run.
