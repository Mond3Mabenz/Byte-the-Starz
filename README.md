Group Members : Buhle, Sibahle, Monde, Qaqamba, Lerato
Group Tutor:  daanyaal salie	
Project Tile: Ping Pong

Code: (Instructions on how to run the code)
The code should be saved from github by pulling or saving directly. Open android studio and open saved file. Run the code and enjoy the game.

Tools: whether on cmd,android studio or other programme

Assumptions: (Hypothesis on how game will run)
The game should have two paddles on opposite ends, controlled by two players repectively.The paddles will move vertically in opposite directions across the y-axis.
The players will controll the paddles in such a way that they prevent the ball which will be moving randomly across the screen from leaving the screen on their respective sides. If the ball happens to leave the screen on one end then the player on the opposite end gets a point. The maximum point that can be reached will be set to 7 and a player that reaches this point will win.

Limitations(What the game cant do)
-The direction in which the ball will move must not be predictable.
-Paddle must not move freely and must move only across the y-axis.
-Paddle must not move on  their own, must be controlled by player.
-Point must not give free scores,the ball has to pass the paddle for it to count as a score.
-The maximum point must be 7.
